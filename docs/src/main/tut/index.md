EvilPlot is a combinator-based data visualization library written in Scala. Its main objective is to enable composed, principled and infinitely customizable data visualization without the need to cross from Scala into languages like R or Python. EvilPlot offers a handful of ways to create simple plots, along with a bunch of combinators for making more complicated plots out of those simpler ones. Everything is backed by a high-level two-dimensional drawing API, making it easy to invent new components for your plots from scratch.

Check out our [documentation](/cibotech/evilplot/docs/index.html), where you can learn just how easy and awesome it is to get going with EvilPlot. Alternatively, skip straight to the [Plot Catalog](/cibotech/evilplot/docs/plot-catalog.html) for some examples of what EvilPlot can do, along with code. You can also take a look at the complete [API documentation](/cibotech/evilplot/scaladoc/jvm/index.html) or the source on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/cibotech/evilplot).
